 ** Better understand if your users managed to accomplish their objectives upon using the site 
 or app, with a simple post-task intercept survey.
 **

 It can help to answer:
  * What goal did the user want to achieve on the website/app?
  * Did the user achieve the intended goal?
  * Is there anything, that inhibits them from achieving their goal?
  *  What does the user demographics look like? 

 

## In a Nutshell
Users are randomly selected whilst they are using the site/app and in real-time intercepted 
with a short two-part survey, firstly asking them what they are intending to achieve. This can 
be open-ended or have some options to help guide them, that reduce vague answers like "browsing" 
or "shopping".

Upon submitting the first part of the survey they are told to continue with their task 
and when they are done, to return to the survey to answer the last few questions.

The second part of the survey asks if they managed to achieve their goals, and elicits 
basic demographic information.

The survey results are then analysed by the researcher.


## When is it Typically Used?
Used during the assessment phase of products, to understand real world usage and refine 
the product experience. 


## Measures
Measures vary and are dependent on the questions asked, scores such as NPS are typically gathered. 
A number of inferred statistics can also be generated using the survey answers, or a further analysis 
of open ended questions.



## Real World Tips
 * Response rates can be low, especially if right at the beginning of their task, consider intercept 
 surveys later on at the end of the goal.
 * Having a blank text box to capture intent, can yield low quality results which provide little insights, 
 consider having some options alongside it.
 * Include a few demographic questions in the survey to better understand your users.
 * Keep surveys short, 3-5 questions is more than enough.
 * Collected demographics data can help inform personas.
 * Include the NPS question in the survey - "How likely are you to recommend this website to a friend?"
 

## Positives
  * Cost effective to create and run on an on-going basis.
  * Can be quick to get results if you have high traffic.
  
  
## Drawbacks
  * Open ended questions need to be categorised, into meaningful groups and can be time consuming.
  * Success of task completion is determined by the user - not if the task was actually completed.
  * Can be very slow to get results if you have low traffic.
  
  
## Example Scenario
A library website might perform a true-intent study to see if users are completing the goals they set 
out to achieve. 

A sample of users would be randomly intercepted on the home page when initially arriving on the site and 
prompted to complete the first part of the survey, then told to continue on to their task. Upon completing 
their task users would return to finish the remainder of the survey.

The researcher could analyse the results to infer statistics such as the number of users that managed to 
successfully complete their intended tasks.
